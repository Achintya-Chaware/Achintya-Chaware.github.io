 I am a high school student from the town of Karanja Lad in Maharashtra. I did my secondary and higher education from J.C. High School and Junior College. I have passed my SSC exam with a score of 95% and appeared for the HSC exam this year. Currently, I am preparing for various engineering entrance exams.
 
 ##  More about me
 I am extremely interested in technology old and new. I closely follow hacking and DIY communities. I also know basic electronics and I do Arduino projects as a hobby. I love to make things with my hands be it an Arduino project or some artwork or even food! Speaking of food, I love both making and eating food. My other interests include Formula 1 and photography. I am a huge F1 fan and an amateur photographer. I have also very recently developed an interest in videography.

Apart from that, lately, I have started coding and I have done courses on python and Flutter. I have also developed a major interest in space and rocket science and I am desperate to know more about it.
