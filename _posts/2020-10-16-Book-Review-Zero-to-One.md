Zero to One is a book by Peter Theil with Blake Masters. It is supposed to be a book about startups and building the future. But I think it's really a book about the future and philosophy. I recommend this book to you even if you have no interest in startups. I think that Peter Thiel has a really different perspective of the the future and that perspective is very contradictory to the image of the world most of us have in our heads. Reading this book was a very enlightening experience for me. And I think more people should read it and just think about the theory he has put forth.
I completely agree with what Elon Musk has to say about this book:
>"Peter Thiel has built multiple breakthrough companies, and Zero to One shows how."
