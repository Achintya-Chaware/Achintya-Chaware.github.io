I completed this course this month. It was conducted by IBM Quantum and The Coding School. This course was very interesting especially because it introduced me to a relatively very new field. I always wanted to learn something very new and different which is related to physics and latest technology and this kind of got me started on that. The course definitely taught me a lot of things and made me more curious about seemingly very difficult concepts which I always thought were out of my reach. Overall, it was a great experience. I also think that the instructors were very good and they conducted the course flawlessly. I am looking forward to learning further in this field.
