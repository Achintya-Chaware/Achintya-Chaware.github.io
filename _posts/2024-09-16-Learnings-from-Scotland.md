In my engineering at MIT WPU, I was a part of a student team called Vegapod Hyperloop. I joined the team towards the end of my first year as an electronics and navigation engineer, then became the Head of the electronics and navigation subsystem in the next year.

Vegapod Hyperloop is a student team working towards building the technologies for the Hyperloop which is a fifth mode of transportation envisioned by Elon Musk that focuses on speed and sustainability. Hyperloop is a futuristic transportation system that envisions eliminating all friction from the current high speed trains. The “pods” will levitate and won’t touch the track eliminating friction and they will run inside vacuum tubes eliminating drag. This whole system will use advanced technologies and material and will be powered using a sustainable source of energy.

Every year, we participate in a competition called the European Hyperloop Week. This competition is organized collectively by four student hyperloop teams from University of Edinburgh, Technical University of Valencia (UPV), ETH Zurich and TU Delft. Teams from various top universities globally participate in this competition. The nature of competition is quite open ended in a way that it does not define a hyperloop system in any way but the development has to be done adhering to a very strict rulebook with a core focus on safety. The competition has 4 stages, namely, the Intent to Demonstrate (ITD), the Final Design Documentation (FDD), the Testing and Safety Documentation (TSD) and the final jury round at the venue of the competition.

The EHW 2023 was held at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. I participated in that competition along with the team as the Head of Electronics in that competition. For the previous one year leading up to the competition, I led a team of 5-6 people working on the electronics and navigation system of the pod which was responsible for controlling the entire pod and acquiring various data about its health and performance. For a new team like ours with a very low budget compared to others, we did quite well. We became the first Indian team to clear the TSD rounds and to be inspected by the jury, and the jury was very happy with the work we had done to say the least.
