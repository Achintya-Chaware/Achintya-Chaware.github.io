In my engineering at MIT WPU, I was a part of a student team called Vegapod Hyperloop. I joined the team towards the end of my first year as an electronics and navigation engineer, then became the Head of the electronics and navigation subsystem in the next year.
Vegapod Hyperloop is a student team working towards building the technologies for the Hyperloop which is a fifth mode of transportation envisioned by Elon Musk that focuses on speed and sustainability. Hyperloop is a futuristic transportation system that envisions eliminating all friction from the current high speed trains. The “pods” will levitate and won’t touch the track eliminating friction and they will run inside vacuum tubes eliminating drag. This whole system will use advanced technologies and material and will be powered using a sustainable source of energy.
