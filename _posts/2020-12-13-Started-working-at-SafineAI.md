SafineAI is a Duke University spinout company. They make intelligent, machine learning-enabled microscopes. They're working on some of the latest developments in computational imaging to make it happen and it is amazing to be a part of the development process. Also, contributing to real-world development work was always on my checklists and I am glad that I got myself started with that. So far, I have designed a few circuit boards for the device and now I am working on embedded software development. Designing the circuit boards was a great experience because I got to know about the challenges and considerations that come in real-life development with cost and other constraints.  I am looking forward to an exciting time with them. I'll keep posting updates here.
