Just completed this course. It was a fun one! I think that developing front end in an OOP language really makes you appreciate OOP. This particular course is very nice and they have put a lot of focus on fundamentals. Also, something I like about Flutter is that you can make both Android and iOS apps and also websites using it.  I recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn front end development from scratch. I have also purchased the full version of this course on Udemy and I am doing it right now.
